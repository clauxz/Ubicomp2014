Exchanging and organizing opinions in groups is an integral part of problem solving. One such methods commonly used is called affinity diagram. Affinity Diagramming is often created by writing individual opinions on a post-it note and collaborating with others by moving and arranging the post-it notes to form groups and links in order to makes sense of each other opinions. Despite being a common standard, this traditional paper-based methods could be improved with new technology integration. Introducing Digital Affinity Diagram system (DADS), a digital post-it note creation and organization system that integrate private creation and public organization space under one computer terminal setup. Using an extended dual-monitor to separate the two spaces, individual can build stronger personal opinions by attaching reference in private space and collaboratively organize group opinions in a cross-terminal synchronized public space.  Comparative studies are conducted to determine which of the two methods has stronger usability rating.

\section{Introduction}
Exchanging and organizing ideas between groups is an integral part of participatory design. One such methods commonly used to exchange and organize ideas between people is a method called affinity diagram. Affinity Diagramming is often created by writing individual ideas on a post-it note and together with other participants, they move and arrange the post-it note to create groups and links in accordance to the ideas similarities. While brainstorming is widely used as a method of idea generation, there is less work on how groups can deepen ideas.\cite{dickey2012framespaces}
 In this paper, we introduce Digital Affinity Diagram system (DADS), an individual control multi-user synchronized affinity diagram system, DADS allow each users to control the manipulation of the digital post-it note, while concurrently synchronizing the manipulation outcome across multiple users screen in real-time. The synchronization is achieved by utilizing low-latency, highly optimize network socket server which update and broadcast each manipulation command in high frequency. This technology allows allow multiple users to collaborate together in creating affinity diagram together under one single sandbox. To proof the system usefulness, we perform comparison experiment between traditional methods of affinity diagram using post-it note with DADS. Usability survey and performance metrics are calculated and analyses to determine which of the two methods is more preferred by users and determining whether DADS support users in exchanging and organizing ideas through collaborative affinity diagram. Separating public interaction space and private interaction space helps to alleviate anxiety of users. The users will have the space 
In this paper, we aim to show our developed system that aims to solve  problems that arises from  conducting exchanging of ideas through traditional methods. Based on the observation of these challenges we are able to design some technical solution to circumvent these problem and at the same time augment new capabilities to give more possibilities for users when conducting  ideas exchanging activities in group. By leveraging commonly available  and familiar technical system, we have design  an extremely user friendly  collaborative system to support and  augment the capabilities. We will perform the task and explain the problem.  task explain.  


\section{Proposed System Architecture}


\section{System Architecture}
\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.9\columnwidth]{system}
\caption{{A} Single individual setup with dual extended multi touch monitor at the right side (B) 3 person group setup with a larger monitor at the center}
\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Hardware Setup}


We designed a three-person seating arrangement with synchronous access for this experiment. The system can accommodate 4 or more individuals, and allows an asynchronous option when remote access is required. The current setup demonstrates what we imagine will be the most common use of the system, to facilitate face-to-face Affinity Diagram creation meetings for small teams. 

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{U-shaped Seating Arrangement} - This seating design optimizes the dual monitor system and proximity between each participants. In our 3-person experiments, a large monitor acts as a shared public screen visible by all participants. Even though all secondary screens are synchronized, the large screen serves to assure participants that their manipulations and additions were recorded and synchronized with all other users' boards. 
\item \textbf{Extended Dual Multi-Touch Monitor} - For each user, their main laptop is located centrally, while their external monitor is to their left side, giving space for the mouse on the right side. We chose to use a multi-touch enabled monitor tilted at 30 degrees, to give users best access to the public space as a virtual 'drawing board,' and also allow eye-level contact for increased gaze awareness between users. 
\item \textbf{Server Setup} - Our server uses Windows 8, which acts as a database system and a synchronized input-output traffic center. The server does not require high performance for less than 5 simultaneous participants, and rather than high speed performance, the system prefers low latency in order to allow the high-frequency refresh of simultaneous workspaces.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Software design}


The system's software was developed using C\#, mainly Microsoft's .Net 4.5  framework. We built the software natively, choosing Microsoft libraries over other .Net open-source libraries to increase compatibility across critical server, database, and client infrastructure. In addition, we also took advantage of the touch framework library that is currently maturing in Windows 7/8. This library allowed us to include a large screen multitouch monitor in our solution. We utilize a traditional laptop system running Windows 7 and extend the screen with a 22" Iiyama multitouch monitor. The multitouch monitor uses a four-point infrared sensor to detect accurate multitouch from users, and has an 8ms response time. We chose a dual-screen design to increase information display clarity and focus for the users. While the main Private input screen will act as each user's personal input interface,  the public board will focus on collaboration. 


\subsubsection{Private Input Interface}

The private input interface is designed to maximize visibility and navigation capabilities for users viewing both their own points and others' points. Following MMOG design standards, each discussion topic is treated as a separate room. Users are asked to give their name and select a color to represent their points on the common board. After identifying themselves, they choose a discussion room to participate in, and upon entering, each user can be identified by their chosen color.  


There are 5 separate areas in the private dashboard. The private input interface is a workspace intended for users to create points by inputting ideas and information. Figure 1 shows the 3 column dashboard: in the top right hand users can select different topics and switch from one topic to another; the middle column lists all the opinion titles written by each participant; the bottom right corner is where users select and view different participants' points; the lower center column lists the titles of other participants' points. Finally, the full screen right-hand column is where users construct their own points. Three distinct areas allow users to give each idea a title, description, and source documents that support each idea. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{private}
\caption{Private Space User Interface}
\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

Users can switch freely between the input dashboard and a browser window when they are searching for supporting material.  Early in the development phase, we observed that users often search for more information on the Internet to verify or affirm  their ideas. To support this behavior, our system's source attachment function gives users the ability to attach articles or sources from the Internet to their ideas. We developed two features that allow users to enhance their ideas with evidence: Media Attachment, and Screen Shot. Media Attachment allows users to employ the familiar copy and paste functions to upload images from the web. While using the Internet browser, users are able to right-click the images they wish to upload and copy and paste the image url to our media text box in the system's private input form. The system automatically detects the presence and format of media, prompting users to correct badly formatted URLs and showing thumbnails of successfully processed images. We also observed that some users wanted to capture whole areas of a website, or graphics that are not in a standard image format, so we incorporated a screenshot function. After pressing the screenshot button in our system, the main web browser will be displayed, and users can scroll up and down to the desired part of the page. Clicking on the screen will initiate the capture window, and letting go of the drag window will capture the screen selection. The screen shot thumbnail is automatically displayed in the private input screen, indicating that the capture was successful. 


\begin{itemize}
The private space interface allows users to easily create points related to a topic and populate them with information using familiar cut-and-paste mechanics. A basic interaction process would involve selecting the topic from the Topic window (pictured in Figure 1) and creating a new point in the User Point window, which creates a new card on the Public Information space related to that topic. Users can be identified as the author of a point by the color of the card. After creating a point, users can illustrate their point by adding supplementary information, images, and links in the Private Information Input window. When they are done adding information, the card is complete and they can create a new point, or browse other users' points, just as in the analog version of AD creation.

\subsubsection{Public Interactive Space}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{public4}
\caption{(A) Screenshot of Public Space interface with groups and links (B) Card Expansion: double tap gesture expands the selected card to display in-depth information including details, images and comments}
\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}
In the public space interface, points written in the private input space are displayed as cards with the author's identity color. The card also displays the point's title and the author's name. These cards can be rearranged by touching and dragging them to a new location on the multitouch screen.

We believe that to achieve collaboration, the public board has to be synchronized smoothly across different users. To achieve this goal, we utilized core technology from a massively multiplayer online gaming (MMOG) system that uses network sockets, and adapted the technology to suit our system. Participants are treated like players in a MMOG system, with a unique identity and the ability to manipulate idea boxes and enlarge the details of other participants' ideas. These manipulation input commands are constantly sent to the server, and updates are broadcast to other clients at up to 15 commands per second.  Low latency will determine the smoothness of the public board's control and manipulation responses. 


Five key features of the public space allow users to assemble an affinity diagram as easily - or more easily - than they can with the traditional sticky-notes-and-pen "analog" method.

\begin{itemize}


\item  \textbf{In-depth Card Details} - Cards on the public surface display only the title of the user's idea. Users can expand the card details by double-clicking on the card. This triggers a window that displays all of the in-depth information that the author included in the idea's supporting materials, including the description, attached links, and media sources. 
\item  \textbf{Presentation Mode} - Card expansion actions are individually controlled by default. Users can also synchronize card expansions between users or across the whole teaming order to help users control and present their ideas easily, especially during the explanation phase of Affinity Diagram creation.
\item \textbf{Grouping and Linking} -  Grouping and linking cards can be accomplished using certain motions on the multitouch monitor. If a user presses the 'Group' button and touches cards on the public board with a circular motion between several cards, a border around these cards is created, and these grouped cards can be moved as a unit. Groups of cards can be reorganized by moving any card within the group. Inserting new cards into an existing group happens if any 2 corners of an ungrouped card touches the group. If this occurs, it initiates a regroup function that allows users to insert a new card into the group. Users can link cards or groups to each other by pressing the 'Link' button and clicking two cards in sequence.  
\item \textbf{Vector Free Draw} - The free Draw System is a function where, we users can freely on the public space unlike typical drawing system, we used a new methods called vectored drawing, where the draw divided into vectored, Each time users draw, users need to initiate a finish draw function where the draw are converted to object vector , where users can move resize the draw, this is designed to give flexibility for the users to organize the draw around 
\item \textbf{Commenting System} - This function replicates the commenting phase of the analog Affinity Diagram process by allowing users to comment on each other's ideas, ask questions, and write comments via the system. Users can expand any card and write comments on another person's ideas. In addition, users are notified of new comments via the system, which allows users to have real-time exchanges with each other. 



\subsection{Testing the system}
Typical group work in which ideas are exchanged involves four main activity types, which generally occur in the linear order below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Idea Creation - Users create a new idea based on his or her opinion and perceptions of a single topic. If users have internet access, there are two common behaviors during the idea creation phase. One is to start writing immediately, and use internet-based information to verify their ideas. The other behavior is to search for inspiration on the internet first, and write down ideas based on information discovered in their search. Both idea creation patterns benefited from attaching internet sources (images or URLs) to their ideas. 
\item Presenting - Even though ideas are always visible on the public board, having ideas explained by their creator is more persuasive than merely reading them. Therefore, our goal was to build a system that helps users explain their ideas easily. We believe that the availability of sources to support ideas will increase users' confidence. A system that allows users to control and broadcast their sources during the explanation phase will increase ease of explanation for idea creators, and increase the whole team's level of understanding.
\item Comment and Exchange Ideas - Each idea is unique in nature, and questions and critics are asked regarding ideas. Thus we think that it is important that users can easily navigate to specific ideas and leave a comment. We also noticed that it is important that users are notified when there is a new comment written on their ideas. so users are able to response to the comments written by other users. 
\item Collaborative Affinity Diagram -To organize all the users ideas to give a common overview of the opinions of the group, we utilize the methods called affinity diagram to organize the ideas. Affinity diagram is a simple methods that groups and link similar and related ideas and ideas to give a better clarity to the simplicity of the overall group ideas. The clarity of the group ideas is the precursor for any problem solving tasks and having strong common overview will help participation design activities such as solving problem or creating solution more effectively. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Methodology}

In order to test the usability of our system against traditional methods, we set up two different idea exchange environments which we refer to as Analog and Digital methods. In the analog method, traditional tools are used including a whiteboard, colored sticky notes, and colored markers. Ideas and comments are written on numbered sticky notes. Users write their idea's title using a marker, and comments are written using a black pen. Comments are pasted below the relevant idea note, creating a physical connection between the ideas and comments. To make the experiment equally balanced, we allowed users in the Analog condition to search the Internet and print out any sources they wished to use. Magnets were provided to help connect these printed materials to the idea notes. In the Digital environment, users interacted with our system to conduct the experimental tasks. Before the experiment, participants were given instructions and a tutorial on how to use the system. Upon completing the experiment, participants were invited to participate in a survey comparing and evaluating the system's usability on a number of dimensions.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{condition}
\caption{(A) Analog Condition: using sticky note and white board (B) Digital Condition using DADS with auxiliary multitouch monitors.}
\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Experiment Procedure}

To help us determine which of the two condition has higher usability rating, we perform the comparison studies between  traditional methods of ideas exchanging  with our system. We choose a 3 person experiment which depicts the odd number to prevent group forming within the experiment. ( If there is 4-person, there is a possibility that 2 person groups are formed ). We divide the experiment in 4 commonly perform tasks in a typical opinion exchange activities and measure the usability.  We give users a two equally popular topic in our host university as the topics of discussion. We also divide the experiment into 4 task

Participants were welcomed and introduced to the purpose of the study. They were then given brief instructions on using the Digital Affinity Diagram System for about 30 minutes, and another 30 minutes to try out the system in the tutorial mock up scenario to become familiar with the systems and discover system functionality. The experiment schedule and task was then explained to the group before starting the experiment. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Task 1- 5 ideas and attach sources} - Each users are given 30 minutes to create 5 ideas on the topic. They are allowed freedom of access to the Internet to search attach their ideas. 
\item \textbf{Task 2 - Present  ideas to others } - Each users are given time to present and explain their ideas to the rest of the participants. 
\item \textbf{Task 3 - Exchanging comment with each other} - The group is given 20 minutes to comment on others ideas and at the same time reply any comment posted to them. They are asked to write as much comment as possible across all the ideas until the time is up. 

\item \textbf{Task 4- Affinity Diagram} - After completing the comment exchange task, they are then ask to collaborate to create an affinity diagram using the ideas created earlier, they are asked to group similar ideas and also link related ideas. 
\end{itemize}
All experiment subject need to complete all 4 tasks in both analog and digital methods (Total=8 tasks) in each experiment group. The order of methods are also evenly rotated in each group which means that when one experiment group start with analog then continue with digital, the next experiment will start with digital and continue with analog, this is required to balance the data. Total experiments with rest took around 5 1/2 hours to complete.

\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}



\section{Measurement}

In this experiment we tried to measure the usability of the system in making them create ideas. 
Those who participate on the experiment  took a rating scale questionnaire to evaluate the ease of completing the task based on two methods. The rating scale ranges  from 1 being most negative and 5 being most positive.  Based on the self rating survey Users must evaluate their perception on both analog and digital and give the score on the following 9 questions . 



\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.1\columnwidth]{affinity}
\caption{Ease of Affinity Diagram in digital contribute to higher perceived level of satisfaction on the result}
\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}



\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ease of Idea Creation- This question is asked on whether how easy is the users feel when creating any new Ideas 
  \item Editing ideas - This question asked about how easy is it for users when editing the content of the ideas 
  \item Attaching Source - This question compared the  usability by users in using attached sources in digital compared using printing sources 
  \item Navigating ideas - This question is about navigating between own points and other points. 
  \item Showing Source - This question is about how easy is it to show points ans resources to other users 
  \item Writing Comments - This question ask about how easy is it to write comments 
  \item Replying Comments -This question ask about how easy is it to reply  comments 
  \item Creating Affinity Diagram - This question ask about how flexible is it to create affinity diagram 
  \item Usefulness -This question ask to compare the level of usefulness compared to the two methods  
  \item Satisfaction of Result - This question ask about how satisfied are the users in regards to the final affinity diagram result   
\end{enumerate}



\section{Observation}





\section{Conclusion}

In this experiment, we have discovered that the developed system has extremely high usability rating from the users, Action task such as creating, navigating the ideas is more preferred  in digital compared to analog, In addition, the number of attachment of sources proves to be higher in digital system with the copy and paste system compared to the print system. Commenting each other points on text based methods is also easier in the digital compared to analog with consistent result, that writing, reading and replying comments is easier in digital compared to analog.  However, when we probe the question whether the system helps them to better understand the content of other people users, We found no significant difference between analog and digital system. In addition, we also ask the question the level of teamwork, we also find no significant difference between the two methods. This means that the digital system can maintain the same level of teamwork in digital despite having  them working from different platform. Moreover, We also conclude that group spend spend more time in creating affinity diagram and perform an average  7 30 mins more in digital compared in analog. We believed the extra time is not factored because of difficulty of coordinating the affinity diagram, We believed that it is because, the ease of the system allows them to be more flexible in their activities which show that  movement of ideaboxes in digital is 4 times more than analog. which leads them to do affinity diagram much deeper. Finally users also conclude that it they have a higher level of satisfaction on the digital made content compared to the analog made content which conclude that based on this experiment that  digital methods do create a better perceived satisfaction of ideas organization compared to traditional analog methods. This proves many of various benefit of the system in helping users to exchange and organize ideas better.
